# Payment Service DB Connection Pool Troubleshooting

## Symptoms
- Timeout errors in payment-service logs: "connection pool exhausted"
- PostgreSQL logs showing "FATAL: remaining connection slots are reserved"
- Elevated 503 error rate on /api/v1/checkout and /api/v1/payments endpoints
- pg_stat_activity shows connections near max_connections limit

## Diagnosis

### Step 1: Check current connection count
```bash
psql -h payment-db.internal -U admin -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'payments'"
```

### Step 2: Identify long-running queries holding connections
```bash
psql -h payment-db.internal -U admin -c "SELECT pid, now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration, query, state FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'payments' AND state != 'idle' ORDER BY duration DESC LIMIT 10"
```

### Step 3: Check application pool configuration
```bash
kubectl exec -it deployment/payment-service -- cat /app/config/db.yaml | grep pool
```

Expected: pool_size=20, max_overflow=10, pool_timeout=30

## Resolution
### Immediate: Kill idle connections
```bash
psql -h payment-db.internal -U admin -c "SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'payments' AND state = 'idle' AND query_start < now() - interval '5 minutes'"
```

### Short-term: Restart pods to reset connection pools
```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/payment-service -n production
```

### Long-term: Tune pool settings
If recurring, increase pool_size in deployment config and consider PgBouncer for connection pooling at the infrastructure level.

## Escalation
- If connections do not drop after pod restart: page DBA team
- If PostgreSQL itself is unresponsive: see Database Failover Runbook
